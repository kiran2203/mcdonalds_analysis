# Introduction
This project analyzes customer data from a McDonald's dataset ('mcdonalds.csv') to derive insights into customer preferences based on demographics and visit frequency. It includes:

Data preprocessing to extract and clean numeric values from customer 'Like' scores.
Segment analysis by 'VisitFrequency' and 'Gender' to understand average 'Like_Score' and 'Age'.
Data visualization using histograms and count plots to visualize distributions and categorical variables.
Statistical testing (t-test) to compare 'Like_Score' between genders.
Predictive modeling using a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer sentiment ('Like' vs. 'Dislike') based on age.
